Neural network to recognize handwritten digits

Data set: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Semeion+Handwritten+Digit

Program uses sample set of 400 digits (40 of each digit) from Semeion handwritten digits set. Set is divided into two halfs of training and testing sets. I have modified the data set by removing decimals for easier data parsing.

Example values for testing: 2 layers, 100 nodes, 500 epochs

Program doesn't run after building?

Make sure to include "semeion_sample.data" in your build directory.
